Itâ€™s a content driven world, every app or website is feeding the content to me. Is there a need for this.

I am not a consumer to content any more. I am the feeder and source of feeding is the attention lack syndrome.

These content driven monsters lust, know that the money is not the economoy right now. focus and attention is the new buisness now.

Why you need to read book every time or some content everytime

I dont understand the fact that how this reading habit is giving me the peace that I needed.

Reading is good but not eveythign is readable. First thing is that I dont want to follow others experince and yes I want to learn from there experiences.
