  

no-observer has lot of things and excitement in things that only exist in mind, hence existence of this inner world is also reflected in outside world.

Experiment 1 :- I am not observer, observation is present here right now, now what happens to Myself when I am sleeping. most of the time I am watching some dream but other time I am not present.

now after this point I don't go anywhere else. I am not real,
