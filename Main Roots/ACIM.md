projection means I am creating something creation process is there

But this creation put me Sadness

I am always project negatively and my imagination hurt me

I like this hurt that's why I again and again project negative imagination

mae sahi cheez ko kharab karta hu apne projection aur imagination see

Such a rebirth is impossible as long as you continue to project or miscreate ([ACIM, T-2.I.3:8](https://acim.org/acim/chapter-2/the-origins-of-separation/en/s/61#3:8))
