1st prayer

Lord Jesus, I accept you today as the Lord and saviour of my life. I regret all the wrongs I have done; please forgive my sins and come into my heart to stay. Today I renounce the devil and all hidden works of darkness, and I declare that I walk out of bondage and darkness into your liberty and marvelous light. In Jesus’ name.

Genetic factors can also contribute to addiction indirectly. For instance, genetics are a factor in numerous psychiatric disorders: depression, anxiety, attention deficits, panic disorders, bipolar disorder, social phobia, etc. Not surprisingly, many people living with these disorders choose to self-medicate with alcohol, drugs, and intensely pleasurable behaviors. Over time this may become compulsive.

Part of the male image is the conquest of women. Another part of the image, which advertising people know, is that men are susceptible to sexual overtures. They are perceived as powerless when it comes to their sexual needs. They will do what they can "to get it," and the best man is the one who succeeds in doing just that.

  

Unfortunately, porn addicts are often hesitant to seek help because they do not see their hidden, often shameful solo sexual behaviors as the root cause of their unhappiness.

But the problem is you’re not having sex at all, and your brain cannot differentiate the difference between porn and real sex. It thinks you’re winning in life when you’re watching porn, so it’s reacting as it should. Don’t blame your brain. Your brain thinks you’re mating with real women, so it encourages you to go do whatever you just did to get that stimulus again since it’s wired to do that.

Do you find yourself spending an increasing amount of time online watching porn and engaging in sexual or romantic fantasies, despite the fact that you have more important things to do in your life? Have you promised yourself that you would stop viewing certain porn websites or using apps and find yourself back there again? Do you collect porn? Have you experienced negative consequences in relationships, at school, work, or in other important areas of your life due to your porn use? Has your porn use led to a reduction in friends, family, recreational activities? Has your porn use caused you to lose anything or anyone important to you? Do you lie or keep secrets about your porn use?

reduces motivations and makes you feel less excited and satisfied when you do things you used to enjoy. And with reduced pleasure and motivation from daily tasks, you feel apathetic, lethargic, and overwhelmed. Life appears to have lost its luster, and when it reaches a certain point, apathy turns into full-blown depression, with you becoming increasingly reliant on pornography to make you feel better, even if only for a short time. Once you’re in a state of depression, you begin to isolate yourself, live in a constant state of sadness, despair and feel overwhelmed, which creates an unhealthy environment. In this environment, it is extremely difficult to thrive in your personal and professional life. Watching porn gives you a massive dopamine stimulation that you typically won’t get from anything else in your day-to-day life. Work is so-so tiring, going to the gym gives you a temporary boost, but it’s a lot of work; watching television is boring, so porn has become the only outletI recommend a long-term, sustainable plan to let go of porn and masturbation with three main focus areas: Limit the amount of time you spend watching porn.
