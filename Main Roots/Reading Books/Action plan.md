What our mind hates above all are open loops. Open loops consist of all the unfinished tasks it must think about in the background, such as:

Unanswered emails,

Unpaid taxes,

Incomplete projects

When you keep accumulating unfinished business, you create multiple open loops that take up mental space. Feeling overwhelmed, your mind’s natural reaction is to shut down. As a result, you find yourself stuck.

  

Mental modals

1. Present vs future self
2. Surviving vs thriving

They accept that if they don’t feel like doing something, they shouldn’t do it. These people merely survive

“_**As a human being, you’ve been given the dignity of choice. While other living beings rely on their instincts, you have the power to overrule your basic instincts and negative feelings so as to grow and become more. In a way, procrastination is the ever-present tension we experience between our animal instincts and our higher purpose. It is the cost of being human**_.”

1. Gain clarity

  

**1. You don’t have a reason to complete the task in front of you (why)**

If you can’t find a convincing answer, try the following: Develop specific reasons to do it (strengthen your why). You can write down your answers to help you do this. Ask yourself what will happen long term if you don’t complete the task. What are the negative consequences? Visualize how good you’ll feel about yourself once you’ve completed the task.

Just get started, while reminding yourself that the task will probably be easier than you feared.

  

**2. You don’t know exactly what the end result should look like (what**)

You also procrastinate when you’re unsure what the final product should look like. If you find yourself in this situation, make sure you know the exact target you want to reach. Try picturing what the final output should be. To help you clarify your task, ask yourself: Do I know exactly what I’m trying to accomplish? Can I picture the end results? If not, try the following: Take a sheet of paper and write down exactly what you’re trying to achieve. Try to come up with a specific measurable target. Ask your supervisors to give you more detail and clarify what is expected of you. The more clarity you have regarding what needs to be done, the easier it will be to

Stop making a big deal out of your tasks If you struggle to complete your biggest tasks, it’s often because you make a big deal out of them. This is how our mind works sometimes. It wants to prevent us from wasting our limited energy. As a result, it makes us believe that the things unnecessary for our survival are more difficult than they actually turn out to b

  

**4. Get rid of feel-good activities**

I believe that deep down, you’ll almost always know what you should be doing. You’re just too afraid of doing it so you distract yourself in all sorts of ways. But I would challenge you to stop working hard and start doing hard work instead. Yes, hard work is more demanding. It will use more of your mental energy, and it might be scary at times. However, as you practice doing hard work consistently, you’ll see your results skyrocket.

_**Practice ruthless elimination**_

_**Say no**_

1. **How to avoid information overload**
2. **Reverse your learning-to-action ratio.**
3. _**Tip: Stop learning for thirty days. If you find yourself taking on too much new information, stop studying anything new for the next thirty days. Don’t read any new books. Instead, take as much action as you can, using what you’ve already learned.**_
