# Intentions

1. I would like to thanks god for making things smooth for me and providing the opportunities It also changed my life completely

# Happenings

I remember times when I was taking loan in every 5 days, life was complete hell and I was asking god will it end or even there will be the day when I will feel at peace.

I was completely hopeless and cursing my existence, I was asking for help to multiple people I hurted many people in that duration. I was upset with my decissions and waste completely. at that time my earning and expendirues are not in sync and relationsships are hell

I lived hell in terms of relationship and financial problems, doubted my self 1000 times, questioned god people masters and myself for all these problems

I never thought for the things that I received today by the grace of god, I meet many people in my life and disappointed them on many places.
