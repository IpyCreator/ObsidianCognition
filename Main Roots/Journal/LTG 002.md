I am felling anxious too much, reason is I am in lucknow and every day I go somewhere My uncscous mind bring some thing from the past and all those memories are there but not resolved. I am moved from that life but these dead memories are there and everytime when this feeling come of my past I feel very depressed and felling the same emotions that I was feeling at time emotion of depression and anxiety.

Other people specially my closed one thinks that bad things happened to me and its okay but truth is they have no idea of my frustration that I carry from that past place now I want to burn this past and want to move forward. that bitch sonal madarchod sali randi ki aulaad mar jae wo bhut bura usne mera jo time barbad kiya hai wo mae kaese bhool jau.

maene apni jawaani barwaad kardi mae apne ap ko kabhi nihar nahi paya us madarchod ki randi ki wajah se

kitni randi aur betichod ho tim sonal tumhare amma kyu nahi mar jaati, mae bhut nafrat karta hu tumse . mae tumko jalte hue dekh sakta hu aur jab tum chillaogi tab mae khush hounga, itni nafrat karta hu tumse

tum behen ki laudi tumko ye kabhi laga bhi nahi tumne mujhe kitna khatam kiya hai aur tum jete ja rhi ho kyu jii rahi ho madarchod chut ki bhawdi teri maa madarchod aur tera bhai sabse sahi insaan, wahi tujhe marenga wahi tujhe katega aur teri maa ko

too aur teri maa dono ko mar jana caheye tadap ke, vishu hi marega aur maar hi rha hai wahi tum dono ka ant hai behen ki laudiyo mafdarchod

tu pata hai kaun si keeda hai jo khoon chusta hai tu hai jiski wajah se puri aurat jaat ko gareyat ahai admi, teri jaesi madarchod aurte hi maarti hai apne as pas k lopgo ko

pata hai behen ki laudi meri naani teri tatah haraman thi aur unki maut dard naak thi aur pata hai behen ki lund tere sath bhbi wahi hoga betichod

to maregi to meregi tadap tadp ke maregi kulta bhosdi wali sonal srivasta teri maa ka lund kahja too bur ki chodi.

mae kuch bhi bol lu ter leye kam hai. ab to meri memories me bhi nahi hai betichod

tu ja ab

maa chuda jake meri memories se maene tujhe mar diya behen ki laudi

ab mujhe nahi pata too kaun hai a sapna thi bhut bura beti chod

sapna khatam ho gya

ab tu bhi madarchod

chal betichod bhut baat kar li teri

ab mae kuch aur baat karunga,

So this place hurts but its okay I am not that weak shit, I am what I created my seld

people helped but I am the sole responsible of my path I choose in my life. I am what I choose for my self not others. its okay now.
