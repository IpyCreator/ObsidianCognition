Something is same while waking up and sleeping. Its is the constant stream of watching. Its watching all the time. I have identity in waking time and during the sleep I dream anything.

I have few questions âž–

- is there something called centre in me
- if there is centre then I must placed it in wrong place
- I think my centre is placed in my identity
- And because of that I have many limitations as a saurabh

  

What if I change my centre from identity to free, Like no centre It is free centre. Is this possible
