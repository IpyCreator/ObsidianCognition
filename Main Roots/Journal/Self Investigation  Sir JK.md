Look at world Around you, **seee**

See the world as it is, don't translate it as your commentary

After seeing things as it is, What would be the next step

Then See myself as I AM

See myself In a non analytical manner

but the min is trained to be analytical

Be choice lessly aware

  

  

because you are free and not frightened, you will create a great disturbance in yourself and around you but you will step out of the trap of respectability

That is the first thing to learn – not to seek. When you seek you are really only window-shopping

“The question of whether or not there is a God or truth or reality, or whatever you like to call it, can never be answered by books, by priests, philosophers or saviours”

“There is no such thing as doing right or wrong when there is freedom”
