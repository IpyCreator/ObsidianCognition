## Morning ðŸŒž

**What did I dream?**

I saw a very strange dream, there are few parts in the dream. First part maitri convert into the dog and the dog was missing. I was searching for him but he was not found.

In the second part of the dream and this part is very interesting. First I saw a girl that somehow helping me.

Then I saw the sitanshu bhaiya solving the very complex problem and his personality was totaly different that I could not achieve in this life I think. He talked to me and gave me a book. It's a very small and thin book and looks very old. Then I saw bodhi ji and her daughter srishti and rahul. Anant sri was there and he talked to me and told bodhi ji to conduct my pat life. But it did not happened and dreams broked up.
