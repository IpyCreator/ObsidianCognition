## Morning ðŸŒž

**What did I dream?**

I dreamt about nothing because I slept very well

**Three things I am grateful for**

1. I moved to mountains
2. I moved with shivi
3. Air is very fresh
4. Finally No more heat
5. Naturally silence is there
6. Greenery every where

  

**Looking forward to**

Just Relaxing today and planning something for myself, I am planning for upcoming days, I moved here because I want change in my self.

**What under my control would make today even more great**

My actions and response to external events are in my control

**Idea for Experiment to Run**

Nothing for now

**If I lived even more consciously, freely, and courageously I would:**

This is the best I can lived right now

**I am**

Grateful and hope-full for my decision about the change that I am seeking

**Most Important Thing to Focus On**

Observance and response to outer actions
