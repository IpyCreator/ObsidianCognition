The trauma….

  

  

Pressure of water is pushing me towards the depth of the water. water is cold dark blue and surface is covered with thick ice sheet, light is coming from the surface of the water crack from where I feel and drowned in the water. water was part of big river that flows near my village. I fell into the river over the thick ice covered water and the ice broke and I sank inside it helplessly. When I fell into the crack of ice I tried everything to get the support but cold water and slippery ice pushed me under the ice sheet of river and I was under the water. I was trying to see with my open eyes but coldness of water was preventing me from opening my eyes and I tried to inhale the air but cold water came inside my lungs and went to other parts of the body, I did everything to live with fear of death but in the end I was drowning. bubbles of air going out of my nose and parallely my life going out of my body. slowly slowly the light that I was seeing coming from the crack is fading as I am sinking deep into depths of river and light of life was also fading as I moving towards the depth of my death. Now it is complete dark and I am dead and A flashback of my life just flashed before me.

  

I am sitting in the horse stable near the one corner of the hall, hall was big and there are horses and there food grass was all over the place. The strange smell of horse and there surrounding was there and It was the first memory that I remember, I was very small and unable to move just lying around the corner and watching the horses and there children eating grass inside the stable.

some old lady came and took me in her arms and went outside the stable, outside the stable there was snow everywhere, only white I can see and cold I can feel. That old lady carried me went directly to the home made of mud and stones. entrance of that house is small and house is also very small compared to other houses around me. there was some open space in from of the house and there are some goats and yaks there. these animals preowned by that old lady. inside the home there was warm-ness and I can feel the comforting heat inside the house.

House was build on the cliff of the low mountain and our village was situated in some very cold place in somewhere. for almost a year there was a snow but for some months there was no snow. There was a river flowing near by our this low mountain, and that river is very near by our house because our house was on the cliff. I started growing as a child as I grow I observed that I am not able to speak and the reason was I diid't had the toung since I was born So I was not able to speak.

  

I did't knew how to speak because the absence of toung, but there was some kind of communication inside my mind that is not vebal but instead pictorial and emotional. My listening capacity was very high because I during the listening I never felt for giving answering back So my listening was complete absorption of others thoughts and feeling, I had developed my feeling sense and emotional sense so strong that by only looking by some face and body gestures I could easily understood the meaning behind there representation. I did had verbal talk to myself instead I had flows of feeling and emotions inside me. Majority of the times I can understand others but nobody can understand me and that developed the feeling on unworthiness and existential quilt that why I this is happening to me.  
  
The old lady that took care of me purchased me from my parents because my saw that I did have the toung and I am a girl so nobody will marry me when I will grow older So due to that anxiety they abondaned me and sold me to this lady for some price also. This old lady had a son and 40 years older than me. This old lady and his son was very rude at sometimes to me because of my disability. I do all the work of the home cook food for this man and old lady, clean clothes and other chores of daily households.
