Buying Split AC, thing to Consider:

  

1. **Capacity:** Take the volume of your Room… Find out cube root of that and divide that by 10. That’s the Ton you need for your AC. Example: Your room’s volume is 14*14*12 = 2352. Cube root of that is = 13.3. So you should pick a AC of 1.5 Ton. Make it simple, because you are not going to buy a 1.42 Ton AC if all the calculation gives you that value.
2. **Condenser:** Go for Copper Condenser. Copper condenser is costly but will give you super cooling and low maintain cost compared to Aluminum condenser.
3. **Start Rating:** BEE star rating changes in every 1 or two years and that is given depending on EER (Energy Efficiency Ratio) value.. So, EER is important not Star Rating. More the EER value less the power it will consume. Example, A model of 2015 with 5 Star has EER =3.22 and a model of 2016 with 4 star has EER = 3.57… Which one you should pick??? Always take the 4 star one.

  

- For a room of area between 120 to 160 square feet, **1 ton** AC will sufficiently cool the room.
- For a room of area between 160 to 200 square feet, one should go for a **1.5 ton** AC for adequate cooling.
- For a room of area between 200 to 260 square feet, a **2 ton** AC would meet all your room cooling needs.

  

In the above context, it is imperative to note that if the AC is set in an environment where direct sunlight falls on it or in the room in which it is to be installed, its cooling efficiency reduces. In such scenarios, it is best to decide on an AC with slightly higher capacity. For instance, if a room which would have been cooled well by a 1 ton AC, a slightly higher 1.2 ton AC would impart the best service if it or the room faces direct sunlight.

  

  

Capacity based on the Size of the Room.

1. Check for copper condenser
2. Wi-Fi feature ( To turn it on / off remotely)
3. R600A / R290/ R32 / R410A Refrigent (Puron). (better refrigent in descending order R600A is better followed by others)

The Hydrocarbons and Hydrofluorocarbons are highly flammable.

1. Low decibel (16 to 40/50)
2. Star Rating (Higher is better)(If we are going for Inverter A/C, the below note will not be applicable)

Note that as per Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), there is 2 point energy rating drop in 2018 for non-inverter split ACs

E.g. a 2017 5 star non-inverter split AC will become 3 star in 2018

1. Filters / (Dehumidifier feature should be good to have). There are few hot and cold Ac which can be used through out the year
2. Check for Ac having cooling capacity at 52 / 55 degree celcius
3. There are variable speed compressor which adjusts power depending on heat load, helps to adjust cooling based on the number of persons,etc.,
4. Check the Air Flow volume and Air Flow type
5. Power consumption per year
6. Check Anti-Corrosion coating for coastal climate
7. Installation Charge / Service after sales
8. Warranty
9. Need to check the Remote, whether it has Led display, helpful during night time
