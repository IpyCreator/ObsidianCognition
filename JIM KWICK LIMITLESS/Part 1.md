Part 2: Limitless Mindset 

LIE: Limited Idea Entertainment 
“If you are like the vast majority of people out there, you are entertaining ideas about yourself that define you as something less than what you truly have the potential to achieve”
BS: Believe systems 
“Stan, you’ve created so many great characters over the years, like the Avengers and X-Men,” I said. “Who’s your favorite character?”
He didn’t even hesitate a second.
“Iron Man,” he said. “And who’s yours?”
I pointed to his tie. “That would be Spiderman.”
Stan nodded and said, “With great power comes great responsibility.”
“That’s so true, Stan. And the opposite is also true: with great responsibility comes great power.”

When we take resposibility to something we are ibuid with taking great power 
“It ain't what you

don't know that

gets you into trouble.

It's what you

know for sure

that just ain't so.”



Chapter 5: The Spell of belief systems 
Questions to Ask:

Why do your beliefs have such an effect on your life?

Why do limiting beliefs keep you from your goals?

How do you reject limiting beliefs?




`WHat this book is about` 
`How author is telling me things` 
`Is it complete` 
`Now what` 

“The inner critic isn’t harmless. It inhibits you, limits you, and stops you from pursuing the life you truly want to live. It robs you of peace of mind and emotional well-being and, if left unchecked long enough, it can even lead to serious mental health problems like depression or anxiety”


The story of waitress 
The belief that we are bound 
How belief make us dysfunctional example is jesus on cross in room corner 
What are geniuses and there common type and how we see them 
1. Dynamo genius: shakesphere 
2. Blaze genuis: ophrah 
3. Tempo genius: nelson mandella 
4. Stell genius: Sergey brinn into samll details 
“Maybe you aren’t the dynamo of Shakespeare or the blaze of Oprah, but there is some combination of genius inside of you that is either waiting to express itself or waiting to express itself more. The key is letting it free.”

Few benefits of being a positive thinker 
1. Increased Life span 
2. Low rate of depression 
3. Lower rate of common cold 
4. Lower rate of distress 
5. Better phsycological and physical well being: Sigmund freud with good health 
6. Good heart health 
7. Better coping skills during hard times 


How to minimise the Limiting beliefs
1. Name your limiting belief: Jesus christ on the cross
   “ try also to identify the origin of this sort of self-talk. Limiting beliefs often start in childhood”
   “That doesn’t automatically mean that your family is their only source. Early social settings can cause limiting beliefs, as can early experiences with education. Some might take hold simply because something didn’t go well for you the first few times you tried it as a kid.”
2. Get to the Facts : past lives of jesus 
   Life has no limitations expect what you make
3. New Beleifs: Instead of changing and crafting the new beliefs one must observe the beleifs 

Atomic habit author explanation

Questions to ask?
1.“Think of a time when you saw someone accomplish something that truly impressed you. 
2.Now think about what personal inspiration you can draw from that.
Reimagine your inner critic. Change the attributes of this voice in your head so you begin to give it less credence.
3.Face down one limiting belief right now. What do you regularly tell yourself you can’t do? Find the evidence that shows you that this belief isn’t true.”


Chapter 6: The 7 lies of learning 
1. Intelligence is fixed: I have the same belief 
“In a fixed mindset, students believe their basic abilities, their intelligence, their talents, are just fixed traits. They have a certain amount and that’s that, and then their goal becomes to look smart all the time and never look dumb. In a growth mindset, students understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching and persistence. They don’t necessarily think everyone’s the same or anyone can be Einstein, but they believe everyone can get smarter if they work at it”

“This shift in language can be applied to anything you want to improve.”

“Test scores do not determine your future. They don’t determine what you’re capable of learning and accomplishing. Take your education into your own hands.”

“Here’s the truth: It’s not how smart you are; it’s how you are smart. There are multiple types of intelligence (more on this later). Like so many things, intelligence is a combination of attitudes and actions, and is dependent on context.
New belief: Intelligence is fluid.”
2. We only Use 10 percent of our brain : Same belief 
3. Mistakes are failures : Understood 
4. Information is power : Understood 
5. Learning new things are difficult : Same beleif
6. Genius is Born : Same belief 
7. Other criticism : Understood

For Achieving goals, Follow this 
SMART+HEART
#SMART
**S is for Specific:** Your goal should be well defined. Don’t say you want to be rich; say you want to make a certain amount of money.
**M is for Measurable:** If you can’t measure your goal, you can’t manage it. Getting fit isn’t measurable—running a six-minute mile is.
**A is for Actionable:** You wouldn’t drive to a new town without asking for directions. Develop the action steps to achieve your goal.
**R is for Realistic:** If you’re living in your parents’ basement, it’s hard to become a millionaire. Your goals should challenge and stretch you, but not so much that you give up on them.
**T is for Time-based:** The phrase, “A goal is a dream with a deadline” comes to mind. Setting a time to complete your goal makes you that much more likely to reach it.

#HEART
**H is for Healthy:** How can you make sure your goals support your greater well-being? Your goals should contribute to your mental, physical, and emotional health.
**E is for Enduring:** Your goals should inspire and sustain you during the difficult times when you want to quit.
**A is for Alluring or Attractive:** You shouldn’t always have to push yourself to work on your goals. They should be so exciting, enticing, and engaging that you’re pulled toward them.
**R is for Relevant or Real:** Don’t set a goal without knowing why you’re setting it. Ideally, your goals should relate to a challenge you’re having, your life’s purpose, or your core values.
**T is for Truth:** Don’t set a goal just because your neighbor is doing it or your parents expect it of you. Make sure your goal is something you want, something that remains true to you. If your goal isn’t true to you, you’re far more likely to procrastinate and sabotage yourself.

A question to ask what is the purpose of Life 
[[Answer to PURPOSE]]

The IAM 
I am disaggreing with the author here becasue he dont have any idea of Who I am, He denoted very small passages on this part and only wrote few things like just replace who you think you are. 
This shows the shallow ness of the author and his direction towards the life I understand he wants to teach the world about learning but exploring self is real learning and limitless achievement one can make. Completely disagreeing on this topic
