Part 2: Limitless Mindset 

LIE: Limited Idea Entertainment 
“If you are like the vast majority of people out there, you are entertaining ideas about yourself that define you as something less than what you truly have the potential to achieve”
BS: Believe systems 
“Stan, you’ve created so many great characters over the years, like the Avengers and X-Men,” I said. “Who’s your favorite character?”
He didn’t even hesitate a second.
“Iron Man,” he said. “And who’s yours?”
I pointed to his tie. “That would be Spiderman.”
Stan nodded and said, “With great power comes great responsibility.”
“That’s so true, Stan. And the opposite is also true: with great responsibility comes great power.”

When we take resposibility to something we are ibuid with taking great power 
“It ain't what you

don't know that

gets you into trouble.

It's what you

know for sure

that just ain't so.”

“The inner critic isn’t harmless. It inhibits you, limits you, and stops you from pursuing the life you truly want to live. It robs you of peace of mind and emotional well-being and, if left unchecked long enough, it can even lead to serious mental health problems like depression or anxiety”

How to minimise the Limiting beliefs
1. Name your limiting belief: Jesus christ on the cross
   “ try also to identify the origin of this sort of self-talk. Limiting beliefs often start in childhood”
   “That doesn’t automatically mean that your family is their only source. Early social settings can cause limiting beliefs, as can early experiences with education. Some might take hold simply because something didn’t go well for you the first few times you tried it as a kid.”
2. Get to the Facts : past lives of jesus 
   Life has no limitations expect what you make
3. New Beleifs: Instead of changing and crafting the new beliefs one must observe the beleifs 

Atomic habit author explanation

Questions to ask?
1.“Think of a time when you saw someone accomplish something that truly impressed you. 
2.Now think about what personal inspiration you can draw from that.
Reimagine your inner critic. Change the attributes of this voice in your head so you begin to give it less credence.
3.Face down one limiting belief right now. What do you regularly tell yourself you can’t do? Find the evidence that shows you that this belief isn’t true.”
