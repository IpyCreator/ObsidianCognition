A good read for somebody who has not read anything about learning 
I have read many things about Metalearning 
If Author has removed the 2 parts Mindset and motivation and instead focused on only one part that is method, that would be the sufficient part. 
The most important part was not written in very good manner
BTW A good read with remembering whole book
