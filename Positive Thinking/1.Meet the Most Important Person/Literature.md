I have read the first chapter and with the stories of following peoples 
- SB Fuller 
- Tom Dempsy 
- H kaiser 
- Jockey
- Henry Ford 
I come to understand few thing about them and a common pattern that a PMA is a must thing to succeed in material world, this external world has some different rules to bend the reality towards me and the right **mental attitude** towards this world not towards life is very important. For life I think there are different rules. 

Author discuss about the talisman and he is right I have 1 talisman and for better clearity that talisman is me no other and I have 2 powers with same strength and that is PMA and NMA. with right attitude and PMA I can be the master of my faith and destiny and also for the soul but I would like to add I can not be the master of my soul instead where is soul I dont know but for mind I surely know where it is and how it is working inside me.

Converting thoughts into reality is a must skill that I should add to my life because this is what I am missing largely and author is telling it clearly how to do it. 
The rules that he discuss is really very important like  the burning desire for doing something very high for me with right PMA, Practise and enjoy in the efforts of the process of achieving the goal. I hate adversity but I think now is the best time for doing it because I by-passed it many times in life and I have regret for that at my mental level.

And Yes the most important person is me in my life because I am the created here to create and manifest what I am seeing in my thoughts and imaginations nobody else will do it. Right PMA practise and attitude I will turn  my reality completely 360. 

Also HAS_BEEN is a very important and the courage to do the unthinkable  is also very prominent key takeaways here for me. I dont want to has been kind of guy because I was few days back and now I am. I also lack courage becasue of my fears and I will do it.

I also believe the book reads me not me and when words of author and me will meet we will become one and I will grasp the knowledge of it.
