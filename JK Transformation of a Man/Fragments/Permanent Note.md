### INTRODUCTION TO THE DISCUSSION OF FRAGMENTATION

In this section of a conversation between J. Krishnamurti and David Bohm, they discuss the concept of fragmentation and wholeness in human life. They explore the idea of fragmentation and its effects on individuals and society, and suggest that direct [awareness](https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&tag=summarizetech-20&index=aps&keywords=awareness) of the fragmentation is crucial. Krishnamurti also questions the origins of Bohm's interest in this topic and suggests that awareness of fragments as a whole is more important than awareness of individual fragments. They also discuss the role of centering, fragmentation, and conflict, and the relationship between thought and the center of a person. They suggest that fragmentation can breed the center, and that the awareness of conflict arises out of opposing elements and desires. The speaker also discusses the idea that identity awareness is not something that one can simply decide they have, but rather something that comes about as a result of experience.



### Fragmentation 
- **[00:00:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Dvtxu1QJHeQ&t=0)** In this section of the conversation, the participants discuss the concept of fragmentation and wholeness in human life. They recognize that most people live second-hand lives, caught up in the fragmented nature of their existence. They explore the question of how to approach this issue and suggest that direct awareness of fragmentation is crucial. However, they caution against assuming anything and getting caught in theory. They also ponder whether it is possible to be fully aware of the various fragments that make up our lives or if we only grasp them individually. They emphasize the need for deep self-examination and the recognition that even the examiner can be a fragmented entity with assumed authority.

### Fragmented Position 

- **[00:05:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Dvtxu1QJHeQ&t=300)** In this section, J. Krishnamurti and David Bohm discuss the question of wholeness and fragmentation. Krishnamurti questions the origins of Bohm's interest in this topic, indicating that he may be coming from a fragmented position. They then explore the concept of fragmentation, with Krishnamurti suggesting that awareness of fragments as a whole is more important than awareness of individual fragments. Bohm adds that the dominant fragment of awareness tends to dominate, and having a center can cause fragmentation.

### Fragmentation and centre 

- **[00:10:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Dvtxu1QJHeQ&t=600)** In this section, the speaker J. Krishnamurti is discussing the relationship between centering, fragmentation, and conflict. He argues that the presence of a center can lead to fragmentation, and that the awareness of conflict arises out of opposing elements and desires. Krishnamurti suggests that fragmentation itself breeds the center, and that the very idea of conflict can breed thought. He then goes on to ask if thought existed before the center, and if it is thought that produces given the center.


### Fragmentation and awarness and centre

- **[00:15:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Dvtxu1QJHeQ&t=900)** In this section, the speaker is discussing the relationship between thought and the center of a person. The speaker asks if thought creates the center or if the center exists before the thought. The speaker also asks if the production of thought is the very cause of a center. It is implied that the speaker is asking these questions in relation to the idea of wholeness in life. The speaker suggests that one cannot be aware of the whole if they are fragmented, and that the fragmentation itself serves as a barrier to awareness of the whole. The speaker also discusses the idea that one can only be aware of their fragmentation, and that it is only when they are challenged that they become aware of their own identity. The speaker suggests that this identity awareness is not something that one can simply decide they have, but rather something that comes about as a result of experience.

### How people fragment themselves 

- **[00:20:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Dvtxu1QJHeQ&t=1200)** In this section, K. addresses the issue of fragmentation and its effects on individuals and society. He discusses how individuals can identify themselves with different fragments or labels that define them, creating a sense of importance and making them more fragmented. He uses examples from Northern Ireland, Middle East, and the Muslim and Hindu groups to show how this leads to contradictions and conflicts with other fragments. He questions the idea that individuals are separate and distinct entities, stressing that individuals should question their beliefs and identities to achieve a deeper understanding and avoid further fragmentation.

### What is the cause of fragmentation 

- **[00:25:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Dvtxu1QJHeQ&t=1500)** In this section, the speaker and J. Krishnamurti discuss the cause of fragmentation, which they believe is rooted in the child separating from the mother. The speaker suggests that the mother's fear of losing the child is what causes this separation. J. Krishnamurti later adds that fear is not the only underlying cause, and he encourages the speaker to objectively consider the source of fragmentation. They also discuss the role of conditioning, tradition, and sociology in shaping an individual's beliefs and identity.

### Role of community and separateness 

- **[00:30:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Dvtxu1QJHeQ&t=1800)** In this section, J. Krishnamurti and his student discuss the concept of identity and its role in shaping human existence. The student acknowledges that his sense of identity keeps him closed off from the world and prevents him from questioning his community and relationships. Krishnamurti probes deeper into the student's thoughts, suggesting that the desire for security, both biological and psychological, drives people to belong to communities and groups for a sense of safety. However, Krishnamurti warns that enquiring too far into one's community and relationships can lead to being ostracized and losing one's sense of safety. The student agrees with Krishnamurti's observation, recognizing that to feel safe and secure, one must conform to their community and suppress any questions or doubts about their place in it.

### Psychological Security

- **[00:35:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Dvtxu1QJHeQ&t=2100)** In this section, the speaker discusses their dependency on others and how it relates to their problems. They also talk about their fear of fragmentation and the insecurity it brings. The speaker suggests that this insecurity is conditioned by a desire for psychological security, which leads to a conditioned fragmentation. The speaker argues that if there was no fragmentation, we would live in perfect safety and help each other.


### Knowledge and Fragmentation 

- **[00:40:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Dvtxu1QJHeQ&t=2400)** In this section, J. Krishnamurti raises the question of fragmentation and explores its source. He asserts that knowledge, which is rooted in the past, is one of the factors contributing to fragmentation and the imposition of partial knowledge on the whole can lead to further fragmentation. He counters the idea that increased knowledge, such as in Bronowsky's Ascent of Man, can resolve fragmentation, instead insisting that confusion about the role of knowledge is the root cause of fragmentation.


### Knowledge as a tool only 

- **[00:45:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Dvtxu1QJHeQ&t=2700)** In this section of the YouTube video, J. Krishnamurti and his interlocutors discuss the nature of knowledge and its relationship with fragmentation. They argue that while knowledge can be useful in certain areas, such as driving a car or learning a language, it becomes problematic when used psychologically. When knowledge is applied to oneself or others, it can lead to a false sense of understanding and control, which ultimately leads to conflict. The cause of fragmentation, they suggest, is the psychological use of knowledge, which assumes that the whole can be understood through parts. This creates a limited view of oneself and others, leading to a fragmented mind and a lack of awareness of one's own limitations. Overall, the main point of this section is that knowledge, when used in a limited way, can lead to fragmentation and conflict in both the individual and society.

### Security in Fragmentation 

- **[00:50:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Dvtxu1QJHeQ&t=3000)** In this section of the transcript, Krishnamurti discusses the idea that fragmentation takes place when there is a desire for security, which may be rooted in a biological, psychological, or ideal sense of security. He argues that this fragmentation prevents biological security, as it causes constant uncertainty and change in one's organism. Krishnamurti also notes that people may delude themselves in their pursuit of security by relying on knowledge and repeating themselves, rather than achieving actual security. He challenges the notion that fragmentation is necessary for biological security and suggests that it may in fact be the cause of confusion and delusion, rather than clarity and intelligence.

### Biological security and Psychological Security 

- **[00:55:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Dvtxu1QJHeQ&t=3300)** In this section, the speaker discusses the importance of psychological security versus biological security. According to the speaker, while biological security is more important, people are often more concerned with achieving psychological security. The speaker argues that people give more importance to their own happiness, money, house, and other possessions than to biological security for themselves and their family. The speaker also delves into the concept of the 'me' and how it provides a sense of complete security and importance for the individual.


### ME the main reason of Fragmentation 


- **[01:00:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Dvtxu1QJHeQ&t=3600)** In this section of the video, J. Krishnamurti discusses the idea that we are obsessed with the concept of the 'me', which is what is important to us. He talks about how it is difficult to let go of this egocentric mindset, but ultimately suggests that we should stop delusioning ourselves and acknowledge the reality of the situation. The speaker discusses how the 'me' leads us to believe that we are the center of the universe and that our opinions and desires are the only ones that matter.
