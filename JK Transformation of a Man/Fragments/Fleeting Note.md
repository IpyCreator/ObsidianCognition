I am understanding it and starting the change inside me and it started with very basic question.
**Why a person is not a whole**
The initial point started from the Fragmentation because of it a person is not whole.
Why it occurs and what are the question that I should ask myself in this context, A deeper introspection is needed for understanding the first cause of it.

-  Fragmentation
