1. **Observation without Judgment:**
   - Practice observing your thoughts, emotions, sensations, and perceptions without labeling them as good or bad, desirable or undesirable. Allow them to arise and pass away without interference.

2. **Non-Identification:**
   - Cultivate a sense of detachment from your thoughts and experiences. Recognize that you are not your thoughts or emotions; you are the observer behind them.

3. **Awareness of Thought Patterns:**
   - Develop awareness of recurring thought patterns, beliefs, and conditioning. Notice how these patterns shape your perception of reality and influence your behavior.

4. **Acceptance and Allowance:**
   - Embrace whatever arises in your awareness with acceptance and allowance. Allow things to be as they are without trying to change or control them.

5. **Letting Go of Control:**
   - Release the need to control or manipulate your experiences. Trust in the natural flow of life and allow things to unfold organically.

6. **Living in the Present Moment:**
   - Bring your attention fully to the present moment. Let go of dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. Be fully present with whatever is happening right now.

7. **Openness and Receptivity:**
   - Cultivate an attitude of openness and receptivity towards whatever arises in your awareness. Approach each moment with curiosity and wonder.

8. **Silent Observation:**
   - Practice silent observation of your inner and outer experiences. Allow the mind to become still and quiet, free from the constant chatter of thought.

9. **Non-Interference:**
   - Refrain from reacting impulsively to your experiences. Instead of immediately responding, allow yourself to pause and observe before taking action.

10. **Integration into Daily Life:**
    - Integrate passive awareness into your daily life activities. Practice being fully present and attentive in everything you do, whether it's eating, walking, or engaging in conversation.

11. **Sustained Practice:**
    - Cultivate passive awareness through regular practice and repetition. Set aside dedicated time each day for silent observation and meditation.

12. **Inquiry and Exploration:**
    - Continuously inquire into the nature of awareness and the self. Explore questions such as "Who is the observer?" and "What is the nature of pure awareness?"
