Ending of thoughts creating image and the knowledge totally on psychological level
[Meditation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbqAQL6kVCQ)

I am not a single identity I am the whole of humanity
**Is Meditation important or stillness of my mind is important?**

## TIME  
	 is the greatest conflict factor that divides everything and prevent the mind for becoming the whole expression, understant the time thorughly

Who is the controller and who is controlled ask this question to myself and **Why I demand experience**

> TO HAVE NO SHADOW OF CONFLICT IS **enlightenment**
